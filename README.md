# "My Friendly Coworker" Application

## This is the code for my exam project for Tech Basics II, a seminar for Digital Media Studies by Sarah Haq. 

# This repository contains: 
- a README and a .gitignore file
- app.py: the python script that you need to execute to start the app
- calculator.py + habittracker.py + todos.py + workinghours.py: individual python scripts where the code for every function is saved
  and which get called by the app.py script
- a report

# To start the app, please copy all the python scripts and then execute the app.py file. You also need to have python and tkinter installed.
